# Turtle-Module-Shapes
Here I generate different shapes or drawings using Turtle graphics which comes inbuilt with Python

## [Random Walk](https://github.com/manhalrahman/Turtle-Module-Shapes/blob/main/random_walk.py)
- This simulates a random walk in Turtle graphics.
- Each step is of different size in the range specified by the user.
- Each step is of different color.
- The turtle turned left by an angle in the range 0 to 360 degrees, uniformly distributed.

## [Turtle Polygons sharing a side](https://github.com/manhalrahman/Turtle-Module-Shapes)
- This generated polygons which share a side in common side
- All polygons are regular
- Each polygon has a random color.
- Try increasing the number of sides till you can essentially get a circle! (Don't forget to reduce the length of the sides, else the turtle may take rounds outside the screen)
